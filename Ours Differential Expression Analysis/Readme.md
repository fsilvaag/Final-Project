This folder makes an attempt to detail the analysis made in RNA sequencing data acquired.
The file Alignment.md gives a summary of how to proceed to make the alignment ti the reference genome to obtain the reads for furter analyisis.

The file Data Analysis.Rmd is an R markdown in which after the alignment we proceed to obtain the reads per gene.

Finally, inside this folder we can find the intermediate files for countind the reads per gene, which the authors refered as [GSE98379_FeatureCounts](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE98nnn/GSE98379/suppl/GSE98379_FeatureCounts.csv.gz).
