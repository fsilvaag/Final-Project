####The data used to generate the histograms in Figure 8 is found in the spreadsheet *Important Gene Families* in the Supplemental Data Set 3 file (Link: http://www.plantcell.org/highwire/filestream/68088/field_highwire_adjunct_files/2/TPC2017-LSB-00099R2_Supplemental_Data_Set_3.xls). ### Step 1: Creating a separate files for each histogramSeparate files that contained the data for each histogram in Figure 8 were created. They are named *Graph 8A*, *Graph 8B - Histogram 1*, *Graph 8B - Histogram 2*, and *Graph 8C*.     ### Step 2: Generating histograms Since we did not figure out how to make JMP treat the data on the X-axis as numeric data, we used excel to construct the histograms.  Besides of saving them on excel, we also saved them as .jpeg (*Figure 8A, Figure 8B - First histogram, Figure 8B - Second histogram, Figure 8C*).
