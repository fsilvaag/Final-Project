This data corresponds to the data created with the "Data Analysis.Rmd". This data is basically the same as the one provided by the authors 
in the following [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE98379&format=file&file=GSE98379%5FDESeq%5Foutput%2Etar%2Egz) 
with the difference that the FDR values are higher for our analysis.
This difference could be due to the model we select for the DESeq2 design because we are working only with Cell type as the model and 
they could have worked with another more complex model not provided in the paper.
