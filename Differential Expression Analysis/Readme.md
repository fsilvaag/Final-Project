In this folder we can find the Differential Expression Analysis. We find the input file with the counts ID called GSE98379_FeatureCounts.csv. 

Equally we have a markdown file in which we describe how to make the alignment and a markdown with the codes and description of how to 
run the DESeq2 package to make the analysis.
