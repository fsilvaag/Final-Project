This folder makes an attempt to detail the analysis made in RNA sequencing data acquired. The file Alignment.md gives a summary of how to proceed to make the alignment ti the reference genome to obtain the reads for furter analyisis.

The file Data Analysis.Rmd is an R markdown in which using the GSE98379_FeatureCounts.csv file  we proceed to obtain the reads per gene using the DESeq2 package.
Finally, inside this folder we can find the intermediate files for countind the reads per gene, which the authors refered as GSE98379_FeatureCounts.csv.
