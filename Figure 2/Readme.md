####The data used to generate both heatmaps in Figure 2 is found in the supplemental data set 4 file (Link: http://www.plantcell.org/highwire/filestream/68088/field_highwire_adjunct_files/3/TPC2017-LSB-00099R2_Supplemental_Data_Set_4.xlsx). This file contains the 80 most highly expressed genes in maize gametes and their predicted orthologs in the corresponding rice gametes.## Generating the heatmaps### Step 1: Creating separate spreadsheets for each gameteThe supplemental data set 4 file contains two spreadsheets, one with data from sperm cells and the other with data from egg cells. Often times, statistical software just read the content of the first spreadsheet. To avoid this problem, I created two files, each with a single spreadsheet (*SpermCells-Fig2A.xlsx* and *EggCells-Fig2B.xlsx*). ### Step 2: Creating the heatmapsThe heatmaps shown in Figure 2 contain the names off the 80 most highly expressed genes in maize and rice gametes in both sides of the heatmap. Using R and Python, I was not able to print the names of maize and rice genes at the same time. Therefore, I decided to create the heatmaps on JMP (Version 13.1), and to manually move the gene names to their correct position using Paint.### Step 3: OutputFiles  *Figure 2A - with embed script.jrp* and *Figure 2B - with embed script.jrp* contain the scripts and data used to reproduce the heatmap in Figures 2. *Figure 2A.jpeg* and *Figure 2B.jpeg* contain the final version of the heatmaps, after moving the maize genes names to their correct position on the heatmap.
