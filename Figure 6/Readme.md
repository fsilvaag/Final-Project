####The data used to generate the heatmap on Figure 6 is found in the Supplemental Data Set 3 file (Link: http://www.plantcell.org/highwire/filestream/68088/field_highwire_adjunct_files/2/TPC2017-LSB-00099R2_Supplemental_Data_Set_3.xls). The data is located in the *Cell Cycle Genes* spreadsheet.## Generating the heatmap### Step 1: Extracting data to a separate spreadsheetThe supplemental data set 3 file contains 6 spreadsheets, and just the *Cell Cycles Genes* spreadsheet is necessary to generate this heatmap. We then create a separate file than contains only this spreadsheet (*Graph 6A.xlxs*). ### Step 2: Merging Gene ID and Gene name columnsThe gene ID and gene names are combined by a underline and brackets in Figure 6A. However, these two names do not appear in a single column in the *Cell Cycles Genes* spreadsheet. The command **=C2&"_"&"("&A2&")"** was used to put these to labels together in a separate column in excel.### Step 3: Generating the heatmapFile  *Figure 6A - With embed script.jrp* contains the scripts and data used to reproduce the heatmap in Figures 6. The heatmap was also saved as .jpeg file (*Figure 6A.jpeg*)
